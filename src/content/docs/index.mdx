import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Starting as a founding Developer Advocate and Working closely with developers as end users for years, I have developed a clear understanding of their needs. I can collaborate across engineering, marketing, partnerships, and customer success teams to offer our users a greatly enhanced platform experience. Having represented the platform externally as an evangelist, advocate, and trainer, I have learned to gather feedback from the user community, blend it with my research, and distill it for internal stakeholders. I bring a combination of strong opinions backed by data and an open mind that is always curious to learn. I aspire to leverage these skills to create products that meet and exceed user expectations, ultimately making their lives easier.
